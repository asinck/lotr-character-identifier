# lotr-character-identifier

%This program was written for my CSC 240 class. The goal was to write a 
%dichotomous key to identify something with whatever subject that the student
%chose. I chose to write a Lord of the Rings character identifier. This program
%will ask the user a series of questions, and tell them which character they
%are thinking of, and give a brief description of the character.
%The engine that powers this program was given to us by the professor, and 
%the code that I wrote begins at the comment that says, "This is the custom
%part of the program: the data."
%No modifications have been made to the program except for the intro
%comments. This program was tested on Ubuntu 14.04, using SWI-Prolog in
%the command line.

%This program will define an expert system and a decision tree.
